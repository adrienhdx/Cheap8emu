# Cheap8emu

CHIP-8 interpreter written in C++ as a personal introduction to hardware emulation.

> CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker on his 1802 microprocessor. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800, which were 8-bit microcomputers made in the mid-1970s. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

Using SDL for input-handling and rendering, the interpreter executes ROMs from the 1970s-1990s
